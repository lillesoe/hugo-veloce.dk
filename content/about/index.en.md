## Origin of Rasta
Well - rasta is as you might have guessed, not my real name. 
It is my handle and goes way back to the good old amiga days. 
Why rasta? I think (!) it was a combination of many things. 
The catoon by Hergé called Tintin, for example, has a criminal with a similar name. 
And the name was introduced when I was trying to do some graphics for a little 
demo group (doing amiga demos) called fieldeffect (rasta = raster - get it?). 
We actually didn't do much, but it was trendy at the time to be part of a 
demo group (at least in the nerd world). And having a nice handle was even more nice.
